# SYNOPSIS
#
#   PND_PCREPOSIX
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Checks whether the pcreposix library and its headers are available.
#   Prefers libpcre2 over libpcre.  The --enable-pcreposix option can
#   be used to enable, disable, or force the use of libpcre version 1
#   (--enable-pcreposix=pcre1).  Upon return, the status_pcreposix shell
#   variable is set to indicate the result:
#
#   .  no - neither library has been found
#   .  1  - libpcre is found
#   .  2  - libpcre2 is found
#
#   On success, the HAVE_LIBPCREPOSIX m4 macro is defined to the version
#   of the library used (1 or 2).
#
#   Substitution variables PCREPOSIX_CFLAGS and PCREPOSIX_LIBS are defined
#   to compiler and loader flags needed in order to build with the version
#   of the library located.
