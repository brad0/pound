.SH DESCRIPTION
Displays status and controls various objects in the running instance
of
.BR pound (8)
proxy server.
.PP
The program communicates with the running
.BR pound
program via a UNIX \fIcontrol socket\fR.  The
.B pound.cfg
file must contain a
.B Control
statement for this to work.  By default,
.B poundctl
will open the default
.B pound.cfg
file, look up for this statement and use the pathname defined by it as
the control socket file.  This can be altered in two ways.  First, if
using the configuration file in a non-standard location, the pathname
of this file can be given to the program using the
.B \-f
command line option.  Secondly, the socket name can be supplied in the
command line explicitly, using the
.B \-s
option.
.PP
The management interface of a remote
.B pound
server can be accessed by giving its full URL as argument to the
.B \-s
option, e.g.
.PP
.EX
poundctl -s https://proxy.example.org/control
.EE
.PP
The \fICOMMAND\fR argument instructs the program what action it
is supposed to perform.  Missing \fICOMMAND\fR is equivalent to
.BR list .
All commands take the \fB/\fIL\fB/\fIS\fB/\fIB\fR argument, which
specifies the
.B pound
object to apply the command to.  Here, \fIL\fR, \fIS\fR, and \fIB\fR
stand for the identifiers of \fIlistener\fR, \fIservice\fR and
\fIbackend\fR, correspondingly.  For listeners and services, both
numeric identifiers or symbolic names are allowed.  Numeric
identifiers refer to the ordinal number of the listener in the
configuration file, or service within the enclosing listener
(or in the configuration file, if \fIL\fR is \fB\-\fR, see below).
Symbolic names refer to the names assigned with the corresponding
.BR ListenHTTP ,
.BR ListenHTTPS ,
or
.B Service
statement in the configuration file.  The identifier \fIB\fR is
always numeric and refers to the ordinal number of the backend in
the service.
.PP
Depending on the command, either
\fIB\fR or both /\fIS\fR/\fIB\fR/ may be omitted.  For example,
the following command will disable backend 2 in service 1 of listener 0:
.PP
.EX
poundctl disable /0/1/2
.EE
.PP
In contrast, the following command disables the listener 0 itself:
.PP
.EX
poundctl disable /0
.EE
.PP
A dash in place of \fIL\fR stands for global scope.  Thus, e.g.:
.PP
.EX
poundctl disable /-/1
.EE
.PP
disables the service 1 defined in the global scope of
.BR pound.cfg .
.PP
The following commands are available:
.TP
\fBlist\fR \fB/\fIL\fB/\fIS\fB/\fIB\fR
List status of the given object and its subordinates.  Without
argument, shows all listeners and underlying objects.
.TP
\fBenable\fR \fB/\fIL\fB/\fIS\fB/\fIB\fR
Enable listener, service, or backend.
.TP
\fBon\fR \fB/\fIL\fB/\fIS\fB/\fIB\fR
Same as \fBenable\fR.
.TP
\fBdisable\fR \fB/\fIL\fB/\fIS\fB/\fIB\fR
Disable listener, service, or backend.
.TP
\fBoff\fR \fB/\fIL\fB/\fIS\fB/\fIB\fR
Same as \fBdisable\fR.
.TP
\fBdelete\fR \fB/\fIL\fB/\fIS\fR \fIKEY\fR
Delete the session with the given key.  Notice that backend may not be
specified.
.TP
\fBadd\fR \fB/\fIL\fB/\fIS\fB/\fIB\fR \fIKEY\fR
Add a session with the given key.
.SH TEMPLATES
Information received from
.B pound
is formatted as a JSON object.  To produce human-readable output,
.B poundctl
uses a
.IR template ,
i.e. a text written in a domain-specific language expressly designed
for that purpose.  The template language complies, in general, with
the specification in <https://pkg.go.dev/text/template>.  Refer to
.BR poundctl.tmpl (5),
for a detailed description.
.PP
Templates are looked up in template file
.BR poundctl.tmpl .
This file is searched in template search path which is, by default,
the file \fB.poundctl.tmpl\fR in the user home directory and the
file \fBpoundctl.tmpl\fR (without the leading dot) in the \fIprogram
data directory\fR, normally \fB/usr/share/pound\fR.  The default
search path can be changed by setting the
environment variable
.BR POUND_TMPL_PATH ,
which see.  To examine the default value of the search path, use the
.B \-V
command line option.
.PP
The template file to use can be requested
from the command line using the
.B \-t
option.  In this case, template search path in not searched and the
supplied file is used verbatim.
.PP
Unless instructed otherwise,
.B poundctl
uses the template "default".  You can request another template name
using the
.B \-T
command line option.
.PP
The default
.B poundctl.tmpl
file defines two templates: \fBdefault\fR and \fBxml\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-C \fIFILE\fR
Load certificate authority files from \fIFILE\fR.  \fIFILE\fR can also
be a directory containing CA certificates in PEM format.
.TP
\fB\-f \fIFILE\fR
Location of \fBpound\fR configuration file.
.TP
\fB\-i \fIN\fR
Sets indentation level for JSON output.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR
JSON output format.
.TP
\fB\-K \fIFILE\fR
Load client certificate and key from \fIFILE\fR and send them to the
server during handshake for authentication.
.TP
.B \-k
Disable peer verification.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Shows a short help output and exit.
.TP
\fB\-s \fISOCKET\fR
Sets control socket pathname.  \fISOCKET\fR can aslo be a URL in the
form:
.IP
{\fBhttp\fR|\fBhttps\fR}\fB://\fR[\fIUSER\fR[\fB:\fIPASS\fR]\fB@\fR]\fIHOSTNAME\fR[\fB:\fIPORT\fT][\fB/\fIPATH\fR]
.IP
where \fB{|}\fR denote alternative forms and \fB[]\fR enclose optional parts.
.TP
\fB\-T \fITEMPLATE-FILE\fR
Sets the name of the template file to use.
.TP
\fB\-t \fITEMPLATE-NAME\fR
Defines the name of the template to use instead of the "default".
.TP
.B \-V
Print program version, compilation settings, and exit.
.TP
.B \-v
Increases output verbosity level.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B POUND_TMPL_PATH
Overrides the template search path.  The value is a column-delimited
list of directories or file names.  To locate the template file, the
path is scanned left-to right.  If an element is a regular file name
(or a hard or symbolic link to a regular file),
.B poundctl
tries to open that file.  If an element is a directory name,
the program tries to open the file
.B poundctl.tmpl
in that directory.  If opening succeeds, further scanning stops and templates
are read from that file.
